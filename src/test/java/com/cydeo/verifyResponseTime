How to verify response time with Restassured library ?

Once we sent the request, after then(). method there is time(matchers) method which takes the response time and based on the matcher we provide, it will do assertion.

we can use greaterThan(),lessThan(), or both at the same time

		.then()
                .statusCode(200)
                .and()
                .time(both(greaterThan(500L)).and(lessThan(1200L)))
                .extract().response();

we can also get the value out of response object with response.getTime() method.
