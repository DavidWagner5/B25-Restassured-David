you can do it through the spartan api page and copy the curl after executing, and pasting it by clickig import in postman

you can also inspect the websit itself.... network inspect

you can also do it throgh postman, using the code button on the side


Response validations

    so far ,we send all request and stored responses into Response object, then did validations
    (statuscode,header,body)
    we can also do all of those actions in single statment by Hamcrest Matchers

    if we are getting one value we can use is() or equalTo() method
    for working multiple values we have hasItems("value1","value2".. ) method
    we can iterate through collection result with everyItem() method
    example
        everyItem(equalTo("IT_PROG"))

VERIFY RESPONSE PAYLOAD/BODY

1.Using contains method (not recommended)
    -treat the respone json as a String and do contains assertion on it.
        response.body().asString().contains("ExpectedValue")

2.using path() method
    Extract values from json body using path() method, the use Junit5 for assertion
        String city = response.path("items[0].city");
        assertEquals(city,"New York");

3.using JsonPath class
    Convert Response data into JsonPath then use jsonpath getter methods to extract values
    Use Junit5 for assertion

        JsonPath jsonPath = response.jsonPath();
        assertEquals(json.getString("gender"),"Male");
4.Hamcrest Matchers with chaining restassured methods.
    we can do assertions in single statement by chaining method in RestAssured
    to find values in the body, we use the same path syntax (GPath)
    then we use hamcrest mathcer assertions to do validaiton
        .and().body("id",equalTo(15),"name",is("Meta"));
