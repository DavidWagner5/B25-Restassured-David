key value structure. if you want to swearch something you put /search

to find id i postman do /:id

q is a developer keyword, it means when we want to get a key, in value we put curly braces and the whole key,value
for example q is the generic and {"region_id":2} is the key and value that yo put in 'VALUE' slot in postman if you want to get all the employee with that region
or like {"job_id":"IT_PROG"}


jsonpath = json   jsonpath method use for finding out the stuff easily


for json files, json path finder is a good websites to acclimate yourself

syntax is usually the same thing every time
Response response = given().accept(ContentType.JSON).and().queryParam("q", "{\"region_id\":2}")
                                                    .log().all().get("countries");


jamal notes

    for automation we use restassured library with maven project

  pathParam = part of the url and comers after url only the value like /api/spartans/{id}  {} means the parameter
  queryparam = comes after the url, it is not part of the url, works like key and value structure
 we chains multiple query parameters with & sign

  headers:
  application/json
  application/xml
  credentials(username,password,toke,key) these are for verifying content type

  status codes =
  2xx
  4xx
  5xx


  body:
 body is the part that we see the data, it can be in json or xml format

 We start verifying json body with contains() method, which is not a good practice
