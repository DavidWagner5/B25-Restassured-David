=================================================
HTTP vs HTTPS
HTTPS--> secure connection,secure HTTP
anytime you visit a website which is https, secured and encrypted connection will be setup between you and the server.
it means when you type card numbers, data cannot be stolen on the way.
sometimes api also require certificates.

if we are getting javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException:
unable to find valid certification path to requested target

exception but we still want to connect, we can say relaxedHTTPSValidation so restassured will send request anyway.

 given()
                    .relaxedHTTPSValidation().
            when()
                    .get("https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/%22)
                    .prettyPrint();

    given().keyStore("","")
                    .when().get("url");


for postman to add certificate --> preferences --> certificate tab, add certificate.
